Safety is paramount in all industries, especially in mining where risks are inherent and communication is crucial for monitoring various metrics.
In underground mines, a reliable communication system is essential to prevent material loss and health harm to personnel.
However, traditional cable communication network technology is inefficient in these environments.
This project proposes a Li-Fi (Light Fidelity) monitoring system for coal miners, designed to enhance safety in the intricate mining environment.
The system includes a network of sensors that monitor temperature, vibration, gas, and humidity levels. Li-Fi technology,
known for its high-speed data transfer, is used to relay the sensor data, addressing the issues of slow data transfer and transmission loss, common causes of mining accidents.
The collected data is stored and monitored on the ThingSpeak IoT cloud platform,
which provides continuous analysis of sensor readings. This data is logged and transmitted to a server managed by the administrator. 
The system aims to alert workers who are at risk of emergencies.
A demo unit has been developed to monitor worker safety. It measures temperature, humidity, vibration, and gas levels, and alerts workers through an alarm. The same information is transmitted to the neighbouring unit via Li-Fi and to the base station via WiFi to the cloud memory using ThingSpeak. The entire module operates on a single-phase mains supply.
